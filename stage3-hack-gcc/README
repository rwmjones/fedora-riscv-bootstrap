Because we had a lot of problems building GCC inside qemu (simply
because GCC is huge and qemu-system-riscv is very slow), this
directory contains a temporary hack: a binary RPM build of GCC.

To prepare the binary tree (riscv-gcc-6.1.0-binary.tar.gz) you have to
build GCC and install it into a DESTDIR, then tar up the result.

You can either build GCC inside the VM using ./configure && make, or
you can cross-compile it (see ../Makefile for details).  Remember to
include all the ./configure flags from the Fedora GCC spec.
